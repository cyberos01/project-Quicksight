# Features
* **Show Data in Different Ways:** Display Amazon orders data using different styles like charts, tables, and graphs.

* **Make Interactive Panels:** Build dashboards that let you click around and explore the data.

* **Find Important Information:** Discover useful information from the data and use it to help you make decisions.

* **Change Visuals as Needed:** Customize the way the graphs and tables look to match what you need.
* # Technologies
**The project uses these tools:**

* **AWS QuickSight:** This is like a smart tool from Amazon's web services that helps us make pictures and graphs from data. It also lets us make special dashboards that we can play with.

* **AWS S3:** This is like a big online storage where we can put things and take them out whenever we want. In this case, we're keeping our Amazon orders data there.
* # Prerequisites
  
**Before you begin, make sure you have:**

* **An AWS Account:** You need an account for Amazon Web Services. This lets you use tools like QuickSight and S3.

* **Amazon Orders Data:** Get your Amazon orders ready in a neat way, like a list in a table (CSV) or a bunch of details (JSON). Keep this data in a special online storage called an S3 bucket.

* **S3 Bucket:** Make a place online where you can put your Amazon data. It's like an organized folder for your stuff.

* **Set Up QuickSight:** Get QuickSight ready so it can talk to your S3 bucket. Think of it as giving QuickSight a key to unlock the bucket and look at your data. This way, QuickSight can make your Amazon data look nice and useful.
