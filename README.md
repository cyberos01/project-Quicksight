# Project Name 
Amazon order visualization with AWS Quicksight
# Overview
This project's goal is to create visual representations of Amazon orders data using AWS QuickSight and information stored in AWS S3. By using QuickSight's strong abilities to make data visual, users can understand the data better and use it to help them make smart choices about their Amazon orders.

# Features
* **Show Data in Different Ways:** Display Amazon orders data using different styles like charts, tables, and graphs.

* **Make Interactive Panels:** Build dashboards that let you click around and explore the data.

* **Find Important Information:** Discover useful information from the data and use it to help you make decisions.

* **Change Visuals as Needed:** Customize the way the graphs and tables look to match what you need.
* # Technologies
**The project uses these tools:**

* **AWS QuickSight:** This is like a smart tool from Amazon's web services that helps us make pictures and graphs from data. It also lets us make special dashboards that we can play with.

* **AWS S3:** This is like a big online storage where we can put things and take them out whenever we want. In this case, we're keeping our Amazon orders data there.
* # Prerequisites
  
**Before you begin, make sure you have:**

* **An AWS Account:** You need an account for Amazon Web Services. This lets you use tools like QuickSight and S3.

* **Amazon Orders Data:** Get your Amazon orders ready in a neat way, like a list in a table (CSV) or a bunch of details (JSON). Keep this data in a special online storage called an S3 bucket.

* **S3 Bucket:** Make a place online where you can put your Amazon data. It's like an organized folder for your stuff.

* **Set Up QuickSight:** Get QuickSight ready so it can talk to your S3 bucket. Think of it as giving QuickSight a key to unlock the bucket and look at your data. This way, QuickSight can make your Amazon data look nice and useful.
* # Configuration

**To set up AWS QuickSight and S3, do the following:**

* **Make a Storage Spot:** Create a special online container called an S3 bucket. This is where your Amazon orders will be kept safe and tidy.

* **Give QuickSight Access:** Allow QuickSight to look inside the S3 bucket. Think of it as opening a door for QuickSight. You can do this by setting up special permissions using something called AWS IAM.

* **QuickSight Setup:** Create an account on QuickSight, like making your own profile. Then, tell QuickSight that it's allowed to use your AWS account too.

* **Connect the Dots:** Make QuickSight talk to your S3 bucket. It's like telling QuickSight where to find your Amazon orders. This way, QuickSight can show your orders in a nice way.
* # Data Preparation

**Before you can make your Amazon orders data look nice in QuickSight, you need to do a few things first:**

* **Get Data Ready:** Make sure your Amazon orders data is clean and organized. This might mean fixing any mistakes or making sure everything's in the right order.

* **Get the Right Look:** Arrange your data in a way that QuickSight can understand. Think of it as giving QuickSight a language it understands.

* **Add Things Up:** If needed, put similar data together. This is like making groups to see bigger patterns.

* **Put Data in the Right Place:** Keep your data in a special online folder called an S3 bucket. QuickSight needs to know where to find it.

* **Say Hi to QuickSight:** Make sure QuickSight has permission to check out your data in the S3 bucket. It's like letting QuickSight in.
* #  Creating QuickSight Dashboard

**To make a QuickSight dashboard to show your Amazon orders, do this:**

* **Get Inside QuickSight:** Open up QuickSight and go to the place where you can make analyses or dashboards.

* **Start a New Thing:** Make a fresh analysis or dashboard. Think of this as starting a new project.

* **Add Your Amazon Orders:**  Tell QuickSight where your Amazon orders are by adding them as a data source.

* **Pick How to Show Stuff:** Choose how you want your data to look. You can use charts, tables, or graphs. Then, pick what details you want to show, like numbers or names.

* **Make It Look Nice:** Customize how the dashboard looks. Change colors, put things in the right spots, and make it easy to read.

* **Keep It Safe:** Save your dashboard. You can also share it with others so they can see it too. You might even put it on a website!
